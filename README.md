# News App
This is my app for the **(v1) Inventory App** project. It's part of the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.

## What is it about?
* The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about the name, quantity available and a picture of the product.
* As such, this app reads and write product data from and to a SQLite database table thanks to the product Content Provider and Contract.
* It uses RecyclerView instead of ListView.

## IDE
* Android Studio 3.0.1

## Tested with
* Hardware devices: Samsung SM-G935F (Android 7.0, API 24), LGE Nexus 5 (Android 6.0.1, API 23).
